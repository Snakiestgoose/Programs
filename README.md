# Program Portfolio
 This repository showcases some of the projects I have worked on throughout my university experience. They are divided into different folders according to the programming language used. Many of the programs come from class assignments, while a couple are from my own development projects. I am dedicated to learning more languages and stregthen the knowledge of ones I already know by adding more to this repository and completing challenges on HackerRank. 

# C

These C programs are from an Intro to C class and Computer Science I class. I do not have the input for them, but they showcase my understanding of Linked Lists and Recursion. 

# Game Scripts

These game scripts were created for both school and personal use to showcase some experience I have had using C#. 

PlayerController is a script created for an arcade space shooter assignment I had.
DreamBattleWave and CameraController are from a Game Jam where I created a typing game with about 15 scripts with different game functions all in C# and communicating to one another. 

# Java

These three java assignments come from my Computer Science II class at UCF with Prof. Szumlanski. 
The professor provided a bash function for testing all test cases provided. This can be done in a linux environment with bash test-all.sh

Sneaky Queens takes a chess board of n size with x queens and finds if any of the queens can capture one another. 
	Ex: _______	Returns false as none of the queens hit one another
	   |_|Q|_|_|
	   |_|_|_|Q|
	   |Q|_|_|_|
	   |_|_|Q|_|

Sneaky Knights is similar to Sneaky Queens, except with Knights, which move in an L shape on a chess board. 
	Ex: _______	Returns true as there is one or more possible moves
	   |_|K|_|_|
	   |_|_|_|K|
	   |K|_|_|_|
	   |_|_|K|_|


Run Like Hell is a dynamic programming problem similar to the Fibonacci or 0-1 Knapsack programming problems with a fast solution. The problem takes a list of numbers as blocks and a runner who is running below the blocks and hits them like Mario, but cannot hit two in a row. The program finds the max combination that the runner can get. 
	Ex:		15 3 6 17 2 1 20
		o-------/\-----/\-----/\	
	15+17+20 = 52, the highest combination

#HTML

The buzzfeed quiz was an assignment for Client-Side Scripting at UCF that tested our understanding of HTML, JS, and CSS. The survey has input validation in a form as well as the quiz, and then the information is displayed at the end. 

PewPew and Pong are games I made for fun playing with JS in-line. 

#SQL

These queries were created within an online compiler to show the full creation of tables and manipulation of them in a text document.
