These game scripts were created for both school and personal use to showcase some experience I have had using C#. 

PlayerController is a script created for an arcade space shooter assignment I had.
DreamBattleWave and CameraController are from a Game Jam where I created a typing game with about 15 scripts with different game functions all in C# and communicating to one another.
